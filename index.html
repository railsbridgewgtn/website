  <h3 class="faq">Who is this for?</h3>
  <p>This is primarily for women and non-binary peoples who are beginners to coding and want to try it out and see what it’s all about. We welcome Māori and Pasifika, those in LGBTQIA+ communities, and any who are underrepresented in tech. We’re here to support YOU!</p>
  <p>The venue is wheelchair accessible. If you require a sign language interpreter, child care or the like, we'd be happy to accommodate you :)</p>
  <p>RailsBridge is open to people of all ages, but we prefer those 13 or under to come with a guardian.</p>
